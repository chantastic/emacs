## What the fuck is M-?

The `M-` prefix stands for `Meta`. "What the fuck is 'Meta'?"

Meta can be a couple of things. In an uncustomized Terminal session, you can send `Meta` by tapping the `Esc` key. Dont' hold, tap. Or you could go into the 'Advanced' Keyboard preference and check 'Use Option as Meta key'. If you do that, now <code>M-`</code> means "hold Alt/Option while typing `".
