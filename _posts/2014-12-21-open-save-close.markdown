#### "WHAT DO I DO WITH MY HANDS?!?"

Starting in a new editor is a particularly helpless feeling. To get started, I wanted to know how to Open, Save, and Close a file. I also wonted to know how to interact with the menubar.

|Action|Vim|Emacs|
|open file|:e|C-x C-f|
|save file|:w|C-x C-s|
|close window|:q|C-x C-c|

## Command Notation

At this point, All but one of the commonds I need are `Ctrl` prefixed. Commands with a `Ctrl` prefix are written like this: `c-`.

`C-x` means:
      
> "Hold `control` while typing 'x'".

`C-x C-f` means

> "Hold `Control` while typing `c` then `f`".
